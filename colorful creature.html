        <h1>The coolest creature: The Angora Rabbit</h1>
        <img src="angora rabbit.jpg" width="500">

        <p>The <em></em> is awesome animal because <strong></strong>.
            The hairiest breed of rabbit, the angora is famous for being one of the most touchable creatures in the world. Fluffy and cute, they originate in Turkey but spread across Europe before being imported to the United States. The angora rabbit sheds its fur three or four times a year. As angora is a highly sought-after fabric, we wonder if owners wait around with brooms.

            Angora is as much as seven times comfier and warmer than sheep wool. Unfortunately, thatâ€™s a challenge for owners who have to manage high temps around angora rabbits. They are pretty hardy, but do thrive better in cooler regions.
